# Distributed_Heat_Distribution_Simulator_W-MPIJava
Parallalized heat distribution problem over a given 2D array and time using MPIJava then compared speed of heat simulation as number of computers increased. Tests to see how the performance of the problem changes as the number of computers in the distributed network increases.
